                                        will meet numerous challenges yet treading vigorously towards your goals, is not what each one of us can do voluntarily. Each person recruited in any of the Armed Forces is expected to be strong and high- spirited
                                        in all aspects. We, not only emphasise on Academic Training but also focus on making the cadets, physically strong and mentally sound by giving them punctilious and rigorous training. The invincible nerve to cope
                                        up with the roughest and toughest conditions comes naturally when we train them hard in the field on regular basis. So anyone who dares to be audacious and extraordinary to serve the nation, is welcome at Arrow

                                    <p>Truly said <b>“Skills can make a career or break a career ’</b>.We believe that building up a strong skill set is as important as the preparation of the written competitive exams. Developing skills- quantifiable or
                                        non quantifiable is an integral part of our training module and the complete curriculum is designed in such a way that our cadets emerge as men of sky-scraping skill sets not only to add a feather to their cap of
                                        resume but to be successful as good human beings. At Arrow Achievers, the cadets acquire hard skills like Data Analysis , Project Management, Health care, Resource Management etc through various training programs.
                                        A perfect amalgamation of Hard and Soft Skills Development is reflected in each and every activity planned for our cadets</p>
